## Horizontal Timeline


For this coding challenge I used JavaScript, CSS, and an HTML5 canvas to create a horizontal timeline of famous educators. The browser renders JSON data from a separate file. I used jQuery to add interactivity via AJAX calls to the server.


Features

+ Overlapping dates render on separate lanes of the timeline.
+ Each additional event detects where it can fit into the open space of existing lanes.
+ How long an educator lived is represented by the size of a circle pinned to his or her birthdate.
+ A summary of each educator's life contribution appears upon clicking the associated circle.
+ Users can add events through a form and remove events by clicking an 'X'.
+ The canvas can accommodate as many events as the user is willing to scroll down to see.
